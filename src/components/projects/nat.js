                    SNAT, as name suggests, is a technique that translates source IP address generally when connecting from 
                    private IP address to public IP address. It maps source client IP address in a request to a translation 
                    defined on BIG-IP device. It is most common form of NAT that is used when internal host needs to initiate 
                    session to an external host or public host.

                    DNAT, as name suggests, is a technique that translates destination IP address generally when connecting from public 
                    IP address to private IP address. It is generally used to redirect packets destined for specific IP address or specific 
                    port on IP address, on one host simply to a different addressâ€™s, mostly on different host.
